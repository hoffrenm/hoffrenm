### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Mika
- I'm studying computer science at the university of Helsinki. I'm planning to finish my bachelor's degree by the end of the 2022
- Repositories here are mostly for the studies

## Something I've been working with 

### [Amandus](https://github.com/Ohtu-project-Eficode/Amandus)

Ever needed a tool to modify Robot Framework files on the fly? No need to install anything, just open the Amandus editor, fetch your repository from your favourite git service, modify the files with the help of the tools and even solve merge conflicts while you are at it!

- Project was made for [Eficode](https://www.eficode.com) as a part of the software production course
- Main technologies: React, Node, TypeScript, Monaco editor, SimpleGit, GraphQL, Docker, Github Actions, Cypress, Material UI
- You can sync your repositories from GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab. Supports most of the basic git operations through the editor
- Has integrated language server for Robot Framework files including autocomplete, syntax highlighting and documentation on demand

Among other things I worked with

- GitHub and GitLab authorization flow including renewal of expired tokens
- Robot Framework language server integration
- External service and repository mocks in order to utilise Cypress
- Frontend and backend functionality to show difference between user's local and remote files
- Lots of e2e and integration tests
- Lots of refactoring, code reviews, acted in different roles in scrum team with

Massive shout-out to all team members who made this project absolutely wonderful :relaxed:
